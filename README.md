# Asn1
This package enables ASN1 manipulating.  
The original source code is taken from Thomas Pornin:  
https://github.com/pornin/DDer  

I did few things:  
* Added some tests. 
* Comiled as .Net Standard (instead .Net Framework).  
* Packed it as a NuGet.
* Created CI/CD pipeline for automated Nugets generations.
